ISV (Independent Software Vendor) licenses present unique challenges for service providers offering hosting services. Here's what you need to know:

## ISV Licensing Basics

- ISV licensing involves Microsoft software bundled with a third-party solution (e.g., SAP ERP with Microsoft SQL Server). This bundle is referred to as a Unified Solution.
- ISV licenses can only be used with the specific Unified Solution.
- ISV licenses must reside on dedicated physical hardware â€“ no shared environments or virtualization.
- You cannot use ISV licenses to provide general hosting services.

## Hosting End-User ISV Licenses

- End-users can bring their ISV licenses to dedicated hardware within your infrastructure.
- This requires a formal addendum to their end-user licensing agreement (EULA).
- The addendum must:
  - List all ISV licenses involved.
  - Explicitly state that the end-user sublicenses the software to you for the sole purpose of hosting their Unified Solution.
  - Include your agreement to remove all ISV software upon termination of hosting services.

## Sublicensing Considerations

- Remember, the original ISV sublicensed the Microsoft software to the end-user, who then sublicenses it to you, the service provider.

## Additional Notes

- ISV licenses usually lack Software Assurance or similar subscription benefits.
- This lack of subscription benefits limits License Mobility, reinforcing the need for dedicated servers.

## Key Takeaways

ISV licensing in a [hosting environment](https://samexpert.com/microsoft-spla/) demands strict adherence to dedicated hardware and formal agreements outlining sublicensing terms.
