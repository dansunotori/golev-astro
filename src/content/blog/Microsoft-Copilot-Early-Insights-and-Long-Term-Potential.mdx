Initial feedback on Microsoft Copilot is encouraging. However, early excitement is tempered by the recognition that Copilot's responses may not be as expansive as users accustomed to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) might expect due to Copilot's emphasis on internal data security.

[Unlocking Copilot's value](https://samexpert.com/microsoft-365-copilot-pricing-and-negotiation/) requires robust data governance controls, comprehensive user training, and a clear understanding of its capabilities. Early adopter organisations we spoke to approach deployment cautiously, balancing potential with risk assessments and data security protocols. While pilot programs are active, widespread rollouts will likely be phased in gradually starting in 2025.

Despite the measured approach, there's a consensus that Copilot holds significant revenue potential for Microsoft over the next few years. The momentum is expected to build steadily, culminating in broader adoption by 2025-2026.

Companies exhibit varying degrees of readiness and adoption. Some are eager to pilot Copilot, while others take a more deliberate approach. Very few have already deployed it to a broad user base. This reality reflects both the need for thorough risk assessment and the desire to leverage Copilot's potential benefits.

Comparisons to ChatGPT are natural, but it's crucial to recognise Copilot's focus on secure internal data access. When used for tasks that require internal data analysis and synthesis, Copilot demonstrates impressive value. However, effective user training is vital to ensure users understand Copilot's strengths and employ them for the most suitable tasks.

While some initial limitations exist, many view Copilot as a potential game-changer for specific use cases. Its ability to streamline tasks and expedite internal information gathering offers significant potential for productivity gains.

From my perspective, as CEO of a [boutique consulting firm specialising in Microsoft Agreement Negotiations](https://samexpert.com/), I believe that understanding Copilot's strengths and limitations will be key to successful implementation for our clients. While initial setup requires configuration, customisation, and training, the potential return on investment is significant â€“ akin to having a personal productivity assistant for a very reasonable cost of $30 per month.
