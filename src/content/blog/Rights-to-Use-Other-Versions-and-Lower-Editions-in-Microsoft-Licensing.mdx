title: Rights to Use Other Versions and Lower Editions in Microsoft Licensing
---

Holding a [Microsoft software license](https://samexpert.com/how-to-buy-microsoft-licenses-as-an-organisation/) often includes the flexibility to use versions of the software other than the one you initially purchased.

It's important to note, however, that while using lower **versions** is generally permitted, the ability to use lower **editions** is not a blanket right. [Microsoft Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForallSoftware/all) must explicitly permit this right for the specific product and edition in question.

## Versions and Editions: Clarifying the Terms

- **Version**: The specific release of the software, marked by its release number, such as 2019 or 2022.
- **Edition**: The variant of the software that determines the feature set, such as Standard or Enterprise.

## Your Rights Under Microsoft Licensing

- The use of an earlier **version** of the software is generally permitted.
- The use of a lower **edition** requires express permission for the specific product and edition you're licensed for.

## The Rules:

- The use rights for the version or edition you're licensed for remain in effect, even when using an earlier version or a permitted lower edition.
- Downgrading to an earlier version or lower edition is allowed where expressly permitted. Upgrading to a newer version or a higher edition typically requires a new licence, although upgrade rights are included with [Software Assurance](https://samexpert.com/what-is-software-assurance-mistakes-to-avoid/) and [subscription licences](https://samexpert.com/what-is-csp-microsoft-cloud-solution-program-explained/).

## Understanding the Financial Implications

While using a lower edition doesn't directly reduce licensing costs (as you're operating under the terms of the higher edition's licence), it can indirectly influence cost management in other areas of your business, such as training and support.

## Licensing Strategy Tips

- Leverage the rights to use other versions and lower editions to align software deployment with your organisation's operational requirements.
- In licence negotiations, a clear understanding of these rights can inform decisions and help secure terms that accommodate future needs.
- Budget for software licences based on user needs, considering the strategic use of different versions and editions to support diverse work scenarios.

## Managing Compliance

- Ensure that your use of different versions and editions aligns with the specific terms and permissions of your licensing agreement.
- Maintain accurate records of your software deployment, including versions and editions in use, to demonstrate compliance in the event of an audit.

By leveraging your rights to use other versions and lower editions, where permitted, you can maintain the agility to adapt to technological and operational shifts within your organisation while staying within the bounds of Microsoft licensing compliance.
